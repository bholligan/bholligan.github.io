After 6 years in the oil and gas industry I am now a recent graduate of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp! From machine learning to visualizations to cloud computing, I'm having a blast exploring all sorts of new tools and algorithms. This site is a home for sharing my projects and some of the things I've learned.

Outside of data science I enjoy hiking, travelling to foreign countries, live sporting events, running, and ultimate.
