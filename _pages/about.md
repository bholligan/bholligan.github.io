After 6 years in the oil and gas industry I am now a recent graduate of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp! From machine learning to visualizations to cloud computing, I'm having a blast learning all sorts of new tools and algorithms. This site is home for sharing projects and other discoveries.

Outside of data science I enjoy hiking, traveling to foreign countries, live sporting events, running, music festivals and ultimate frisbee.
